# Maze-Solver-Game
Game

it's a game, the player have to solve a generated maze in order to reach his wife.

Basic Features: Using graph theory (BFS & DFS ) to find solutions/ Generates random mazes.
Extra Features: Focus on object oriented concepts (encapsulation/ inheritance/ friendship, constructors).

Other Features:
* there is a KEY and a GATE, located in some place in the maze BOY should get the KEY first to open the GATE of the square which the GIRL is trapeed in.

* game generate maze according to prim algorithm.

* there are some kind of help as (solve key) whitch slove the maze as source is BOY and sink is KEY using an apstraction recursion algorithm deal with stack, queue or any data structure to solve the maze, if stack used the apstraction algorithm will act like DFS, if queue used the apstraction algorithm will act like BFS, you can use your own data structure just implement the interface IMazeAlgoro.

* can read the maze from file so you can generate your own maze.

* provide levels.
